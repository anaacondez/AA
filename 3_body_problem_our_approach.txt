								3 BODY PROBLEM – OUR APPROACH 


- Test set does not give velocities – it gives positions x and y for the 3 bodies at t=0 for various simulations, and initial velocity is always 0. 
(??? - why are there various times that have the positions at t=0 in this data?) 

 
- Train set – as some regions of the table with probably “faulty” simulations, where there is a sequence of lines with all values (except ID) = 0; 
this is data that will skew our model, so we aim to strip the train set of it with code/function that does something of the sort: 
	if line all 0 (except ID): 
		line.strip() 
	else: 
		Skip 
(this is an important part of our data preprocessing) 

 
- To account for data outliers and because position, velocity and time are measured using different scales, it is probably reasonable to use some type of standardisation. 

 
- To the aims in 2. and 3., we started by printing out a table with descriptive statistics of our variables across all simulations – summary_stats.xlsx


- We want to predict 6 continuous variables based on continuous variables --> therefore, we can consider this a (multivariate) regression problem
- Variables are not independent from one another - we have to adjust for that non independence/covariance/collinearity


- We have initial positions and positions at fixed times between t=0 and t=10 for various simulations; at those initial positions (that vary between simulations all bodies) have v=0 in both velocity components (x and y)
- Given an initial position --> Where do the bodies go ?
