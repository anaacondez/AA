								3 BODY PROBLEM – OUR APPROACH 


- Test set does not give velocities – it gives positions x and y for the 3 bodies at t=0 for various simulations, and initial velocity is always 0. 
(??? - why are there various times that have the positions at t=0 in this data?) 

 
- Train set – Impecting the dataset, we noticed that some regions of the table had long sets of lines whose values where 0.0 for all variables (apart from Id). Given that this dataset results from the collection of data from simulations with probably “faulty” simulations, where there is a sequence of lines with all values (except ID) = 0; 
this is data that will skew our model, so we stripped the train set of it: 
	# Identify faulty rows based on the criterion (all values = 0.0 except for Id)
		faulty_rows = train_data[(train_data.drop('Id', axis=1) == 0).all(axis=1)]
	# Remove the faulty rows from the DataFrame
		filtered_train_data = train_data[~train_data.index.isin(faulty_rows.index)] 
(this is an important part of our data preprocessing) 

- To visualise collinearity/correlation between the variables, we calculated a correlation matrix (visualised as a heatmap) and we created a pairwise plotting of variables with their distribution (smoothed)


- To account for data outliers and because position, velocity and time are measured using different scales, it is probably reasonable to use some type of standardisation. 

 
- To the aims in 2. and 3., we started by printing out a table with descriptive statistics of our variables across all simulations – summary_stats.xlsx


- We want to predict 6 continuous variables based on continuous variables --> therefore, we can consider this a (multivariate) regression problem
- Variables are not independent from one another - we have to adjust for that non independence/covariance/collinearity


- We have initial positions and positions at fixed times between t=0 and t=10 for various simulations; at those initial positions (that vary between simulations all bodies) have v=0 in both velocity components (x and y)
- Given an initial position --> Where do the bodies go ?
